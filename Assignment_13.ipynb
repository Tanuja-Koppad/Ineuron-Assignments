        "Ans-The advantage of using the CSV files ultimately boils down to the specific use case. \n",
        "You would get thousands of different opinions and answers from all over the internet. \n",
        "It depends on the intended domain of your usage. The following are the most general advantages of the CSV format.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.CSV is easy to create. As CSV format is human-readable, it is easy to create. In fact, it can be done using any text editor (unlike XLS or XLSX format).\n",
        "2.CSV is human readable i.e. the data is not encoded or converted to binary before storing. This increases the readability as well as the ease of manipulation. Moreover, it is easy to edit.\n",
        "3.CSV files can be read using almost any text editor.\n",
        "4.It is easy to parse. The parser is much simpler compared to an XML or JSON parser due to the inherent simplicity of this format.\n",
        "5.CSV format is dictated by a straightforward schema. The advantage of having a simple schema makes it a popular choice for number crunching works.\n",
        "6.Manipulating the CSV file is fast. Due to the simple nature of this format, it is less taxing for the parser to parse the data. Hence, it results in swift data read and write.\n",
        "7.While the CSV format is usually not known for its memory efficiency, it, in general, results in small files. That being said, many other formats available out there provide more memory savings than CSV.\n",
        "8.CSV format is compact. Compared to other formats like XML or JSON, you do not need to care about tags. You need to start and end tags separately for each row and column which can be unwieldy."
